- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rularis and I'm brazilian and front-end and python developer, I've been working since 2020. I'm coding a new web and try to get a job experience into this market.
I speak english(C1),Hebrew(B1),Spanish(B2) and learning mandarim.
I'm studying computer science at EstÃ¡cio (it's a private collge in my Town).
I like a lot work together, beacause I can definetly learn with others around me and share my knowledge and my abilities.
